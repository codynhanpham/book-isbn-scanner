# Book ISBN Scanner
A web-based application that lets you scan the ISBN book barcode and get the book information from the [openlibrary.org](https://openlibrary.org/). A list of popular review sites and online bookstores are also listed for the user to choose from.

### Progressive Web App (PWA)
You can install the app directly onto your device, skipping the trouble of opening the browser every time you want to use the app. Another perk is that the barcode decoder works offline as well, so you can scan all kinds of barcodes, data matrices, or QR codes while being completely offline. Only the book ISBN look-up does not work while being offline (duh).

To install the app, click on the Install button on the URL bar if you are on Desktop (the one next to the bookmark icon). If you are using a mobile device, click on the meatballs icon (the 3 dots), then select Install...
